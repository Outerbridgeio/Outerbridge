### Dev setup

Outerbridge has 3 different modules in a single mono repository.
- `server`: Node backend to serve API logics
- `ui`: React frontend
- `components`: Nodes and Credentials of applications

#### Lerna
Lerna is used to link these modules together. Install lerna by running:
```
npm install -g lerna
```

#### MongoDB

Outerbridge uses MongoDB as database. Download and install one [here](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community?tck=docs_server).

#### Step by step

1. Fork the official [Outerbridge Github Repository](https://github.com/Outerbridgeio/Outerbridge).

2. Clone your forked repository.

3. Create a new branch, see [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository). Naming conventions:
    - For feature branch: `feature/<Your New Feature>`
    - For bugfix branch: `bugfix/<Your New Bugfix>`.

4. Switch to the newly created branch.

5. Go into repository folder
	```
	cd Outerbridge
	```

6. Install all dependencies of all modules and link them together:
	```
	yarn bootstrap
	```

7. Build all the code:
	```
	yarn build
	```
    
8. Start the app on http://localhost:3000:
	```
	yarn start
	```
    
9. For development, run
    ```
	yarn dev
	```
	Any changes made in `packages/ui` or `packages/server` will be reflected on http://localhost:8080
	
	For changes made in `packages/components`, run `yarn build` again to pickup the changes.

10. After making all the changes, run
    ```
	yarn build
	```
	and
	```
	yarn start
	```
    to make sure everything works fine in production.

10. Commit code and submit Pull Request from forked branch pointing to [Outerbridge master](https://github.com/Outerbridgeio/Outerbridge/tree/master). Example [PR](https://github.com/Outerbridgeio/Outerbridge/pull/50).
